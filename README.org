#+TITLE: DWM window manager customizations

This is my [[https://dwm.suckless.org/][dwm]] configuration using [[https://git.muteddisk.com/?p=dwm.git;a=tree][prefix style keybindings]] a la [[https://stumpwm.github.io/][stumpwm]] or [[https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/][ratpoison]].

* Customizations

- [[https://git.muteddisk.com/?p=dwm.git;a=tree][prefix style keybindings]] in =config.h=.
- [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/ewmhtags/][emwhtags]]
- [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/warp/dwm-warp-6.1.diff][warp]]
- [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/autostart/][autostart]] variation with a non-blocking script at =$HOME/.config/dwm/autostart=.

Customizations are in-place in the =config.h= file instead of =config.def.h=.

* Requirements

In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.

* Installation

dwm is installed into the =/usr/local= namespace by default.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:
