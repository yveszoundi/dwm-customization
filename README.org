#+TITLE: DWM window manager customizations

This is my [[https://dwm.suckless.org/][dwm]] configuration with keyboard shortcuts externalized (see [[https://github.com/yveszoundi/vms-setup/blob/master/skeletons/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc][sample configuration]] with [[https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd][sxhkd]]).
Additional =mk= files to allow building transparently on both Linux and BSD (NetBSD, OpenBSD and FreeBSD).

*Warning*: You MUST run a keyboard daemon such as sxhkd, all default shortcuts have been un-configured.

* Requirements

In order to build =dwm= you need make, a C compiler and some Xlib header *dev* files (Xinerama and freetype2 dev libraries, a C compiler and make).
Additionally, please note that the following software dependencies are referenced in =config.def.h=.

* Installation

You can build and copy the resulting =dwm= binary at the location of your choice (such as in =/usr/local/bin=).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  make && sudo cp dwm /usr/local/bin
#+END_SRC

* Running dwm

Please also check the =support= directory of this repository for sample configuration files.

- If using a [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Display_manager][display manager]], please take a look at the various =.desktop= files in the =support= folder.
  - For XDM you need an executable =.xsession= file (=exec /usr/local/bin/dwm=).
  - If you need to run multiple programs such as x
- Alternatively in a TTY, run =startx /usr/local/bin/dwm=.
