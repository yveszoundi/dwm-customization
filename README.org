#+TITLE: DWM window manager customization

This is my [[https://dwm.suckless.org/][dwm]] configuration with keyboard shortcuts externalized (see [[https://github.com/yveszoundi/vms-setup/blob/master/skeletons/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc][sample configuration]] with [[https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd][sxhkd]]).
Additional =mk= files to allow building transparently on both Linux and BSD (NetBSD, OpenBSD and FreeBSD).

/*Warning: You MUST run a keyboard daemon such as sxhkd, all default shortcuts have been un-configured.*/

* Requirements

In order to build =dwm= you need make, a C compiler and some Xlib header *dev* files (Xinerama and freetype2 dev libraries, a C compiler and make).
Additionally, please note that the following software dependencies are referenced in =config.def.h=.

* Installation

You can build and copy the resulting =dwm= binary at the location of your choice (such as in =/usr/local/bin=).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  make && sudo cp dwm /usr/local/bin
#+END_SRC

* Running dwm

Please also check the =support= directory of this repository for sample configuration files.

If you're starting the display server (X) from the command line please use the
- If using a [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Display_manager][display manager]]
  - XDM will expect an executable =.xsession= file (see the =support= folder for an example).
  - For GDM, LightDM and others
    - If you want to use the default =dwm.desktop= file, you need a /dwm autostart/ script for loading your keybindings (=sxhkd= or the keyboard daemon of your choice)
    - Otherwise, you can create a custom desktop file and configure all the default initilized applications in your .xsession file (see =custom-x11*.desktop= files in the =support= directory)
- If you're starting /dwm/ from the command line, either create a =.xsession= file (also symlink it to =.xinitrc=) or set a /dwm autostart/ script.
